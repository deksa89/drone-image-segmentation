UNet model and segmentation model based on DigitalSereni - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=csFGTLT6_WQ&t=852s

Model was trained on 256*256 images and after 110 epoch highest accuracy achieved was ~79% before it was halted by early stopping

This is just very basic what could be achieved by segmentation and there is a lot of room for improvement.
